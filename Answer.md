1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

The "Product" entity is related to the "Product_Category" entity through a one-to-many association, which means that each product can belong to only one category.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it? 

We can ensure that each product in the Product table has a valid category assigned through it using foreign key category_id in product table.
